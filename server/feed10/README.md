# Go API Server for newsfeed

## Overview

This folder contains a golang implementation of the news feed microservice. I used this code as the basis for my evaluation of Go as documented in this blog about [Writing Microservices in Go](http://glennengstrand.info/software/architecture/microservice/golang).

I started by using the [go-server template](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/modules/swagger-codegen/src/main/resources/go-server) from the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.

## Dependencies

I used the following projects.

The go-server templates use [mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) as the request dispatcher.

Access to the feed MySql DB was via the standard golang [SQL API](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/) to this [MySql driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/).

The Redis cache was used to front access to the MySql DB with this [Redis client library](https://github.com/go-redis/redis).

I used the standard [Cassandra client library](https://github.com/gocql/gocql) for inbound and outbound entities.

I used this non-standard [Elasticsearch client library](https://olivere.github.io/elastic/) because it still supports version 2.

## Usage

Here is how to build the docker image.

```
docker build -t feed9:1.0 .
```

Here is how to deploy the docker image.

```
cd ../k8s
kubectl create -f feed9-deployment.yaml
```

## Load Testing

I tested this microservice using the standard load test environment for two hours (see the client/load folder in this repo). The average per minute throughput of output posts was 12,937 with an average duration of 8.7 ms, a median of 5 ms, and a 99th percentile of 23 ms. That means the golang version of the news feed service performed worse than the java versions, was on par with the node.js version and performed better than the python, scala, and clojure versions.
